# **App Name**: Ephemeral Chat

## Core Features:

- Message Input: A simple text input field for composing messages.
- Message Display: A clean display area to show sent and received messages in a conversation.
- Send Message: A button or hotkey to send the message.
- Initial Puzzle Game: Presents a word-guessing puzzle upon first app open. Solving it with the correct 'key' word unlocks the chat. If the user navigates away from the chat or clicks back, the app reverts to the puzzle game.
- Generate Starting Image: When the user initially starts the application and before the puzzle is solved, an AI tool will generate a visually appealing abstract image to occupy the screen.
- Exit and Clear: A button to close the browser window without storing any chat logs or data.
- Send Media: Allows sending files or images, including opening the camera app to take a photo and send it without saving to the device.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming, desaturated blue (#64B5F6) to create a serene and focused chat environment.
- Background color: A very light desaturated blue (#E3F2FD) to provide a clean backdrop without being too harsh.
- Accent color: A soft, analogous cyan (#4DD0E1) to highlight interactive elements like the send button and create visual interest without distraction.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a clean and modern sans-serif that works well for both message text and UI elements.
- A minimalist design with the message input at the bottom and the display area filling the remaining space.
- Simple, line-based icons for actions like 'send' and 'exit', with good legibility
- Subtle fade-in animations for new messages to provide smooth visual feedback.
